## About music

music is simple Python module dealing with Musical Notes and 7-note Scales. \
*Date of creation:* `September 27, 2020`

This project defines functions for the following tasks:
- Create a random musical scale
- Returning the gap (number of half-steps) between two notes
- Transposing a musical scale

and many more...

To better understand how to use each function, in your project, run:

```python
help(function_name)
```

# Run
To use, clone the repository on your device, navigate to the folder, and move this file to your project folder. Import this file in your project, wherever needed, using:

```python
import music
```

## Future plans

- Can implement equality for two scales more rigorously
- Can implement functions to get the natural major and minor scales, given the root
- Extension of functionality
- May upload the project on PyPI
